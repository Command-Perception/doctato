Key Improvements & Next Steps:

Robust Error Handling: Add more specific error catching and user feedback throughout the API route and frontend.

Progress Indication: For long-running generations, implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets to stream progress updates (e.g., "Fetching files...", "Identifying abstractions...", "Writing chapter 3/10...") to the client.

Advanced Caching: Replace the simple in-memory LLM cache with Redis or a database for persistence across server restarts.

Input Validation: Add more stringent validation for URL formats, patterns, etc.

Security: Review token handling. Consider GitHub OAuth if users need to authenticate to access their own private repos securely.

UI/UX: Improve the form layout, add tooltips for advanced options, potentially add a client-side Markdown preview of the generated index.md.

Concurrency: Carefully manage concurrency in file fetching and potentially chapter writing if parallelized further.

Configuration: Allow more LLM parameters (temperature, model choice) to be configured via the UI or environment variables.

Testing: Add unit and integration tests.
